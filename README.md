## Requirements

In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files plus, consider to install [some patched font](https://github.com/matteogiorgi/.dotfiles/tree/master/themes/.local/share/fonts) since the default one is `mononoki Nerd Font`.


## Installation

First clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/matteogiorgi/dmenu.git
```

Then edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into the `/usr/local` namespace by default). Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu (if necessary as root):

```
make clean install
```
